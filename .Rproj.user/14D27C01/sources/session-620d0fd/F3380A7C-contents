## The aim

*To estimate the probability of an individual presenting a mobility profile based on their personal characteristics, and the characteristics of their neighbourhood.*

[We employ **travel survey** data to generate **mobility profiles**, and estimate a **statistical model** to predict cluster belonging based on individual and environmental factors.]{.fragment}

[We aim for this research to assist policy-makers and planners with new methods and data in order to implement transport policies targeted at specific population groups.]{.fragment}

## The theory

![[*Circles of Mobility. We consider factors at four different levels: individual, household, neighbourhood, and region.*]{style="font-size: 14px;"}](circles_of_influence.png){fig-align="center" width="900"}

## The data

-   **Onderweg in Nederland** - Dutch national travel survey

    ::: incremental
    -   Participants record their **daily movements**, **transport modes**, **trip purposes** and **duration**.

    -   The data incorporates **demographic information** at individual and household levels.

    -   We derive neighbourhood and regional information from each individual's **postcode**.

## The data

::: {style="font-size: 20px;"}
| Person ID | Trip code | Distance | Transport mode | Destination | Purpose | Activity duration | Age | Gender | Income level |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | T001 | 5 km | Bus | Office | Work | 8 hours | 35 | Male | Medium |
| 2 | T002 | 10 km | Car | Mall | Shopping | 2 hours | 28 | Female | High |
| 3 | T003 | 3 km | Walking | Park | Leisure | 1 hour | 22 | Male | Low |
| 4 | T004 | 8 km | Bicycle | Gym | Exercise | 1.5 hours | 30 | Female | Medium |
| 4 | T005 | 15 km | Train | Station | Commute | 45 minutes | 30 | Female | Medium |
| 5 | T006 | 12 km | Car | Restaurant | Dinner | 2 hours | 27 | Female | High |
| 6 | T007 | 2 km | Bus | School | Education | 6 hours | 18 | Male | Low |
| 7 | T008 | 7 km | Walking | Supermarket | Groceries | 30 minutes | 55 | Female | Medium |

## The clusters

::: incremental
-   Using just mobility-related variables, we extract mobility-behaviour profiles.

-   We employ a machine learning algorithm to group individuals based on how similar their behaviours are.

-   We identify five clusters: Students, Workers, Work-life balance, Walkers, and Active life

## The clusters

## The model

::: incremental
-   **Statistical model** to predict the probability of a person belonging to the different clusters.

-   We consider **characteristics at four levels**: individual, household, neighbourhood, and regional.

-   We provide a probability (with a confidence interval) of a person with XYZ characteristics **belonging to a specific cluster**.

## The app

## Conclusions

::: incremental
-   Our work employs travel survey data to generate mobility profiles and estimate behaviours based on four factors: individual, household, neighbourhood, and region.

-   We estimate the likelihood of an individual with XYZ characteristics of belonging to a specific mobility profile.

-   This study is fully reproducible in other contexts, given the availability of similar data.

-   This study hopes to assist policy-makers with data-driven modelling derived from high spatial resolution mobility data.
